The following principles explain our vision and guide our approach in Coucou Land.

<ul>
  <li>Protocols over platforms - if you are serious about true interoperability the standards and protocols must come first.</li>
  <li>Design for Modularity - the power of Open Source is greatest when it allows for recombinative innovation.</li>
  <li>Implement democratic processes - be open to alternative views</li>
  <li>Promote forks - encourage different visions</li>
  <li>Build communities - focus on documentation and accessibility of modular components</li>
</ul>
